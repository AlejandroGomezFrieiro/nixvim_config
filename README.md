# Nixvim Configuration Flake

This flake contains a simple neovim configuration using Nixvim. With modularity in mind, some of the thought process behind it is based on
[this post](https://juuso.dev/blogPosts/modular-neovim/modular-neovim-with-nix.html).

# Usage

To run the basic neovim configuration directly from github, you can use
```
nix run github:AlejandroGomezFrieiro/nixvim_config     
```

# Extending

The flake is built to be able to extend it for different projects, thus giving personalized neovim instances.
